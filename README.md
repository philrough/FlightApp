# FlightApp

This is my first GitHub project to host a training app that i wrote - please be kind.

The aim is to teach 'QA' by highlighting a number of defects in a basic application. The project covers unit testing, service level testing, UI testing and does it in a way that covers both automated testing and manual exploratory testing.

The project is a work in progress.
